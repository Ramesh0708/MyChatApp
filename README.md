How to Create an Android Chat App Using Firebase
With Firebase, creating real-time social applications is a walk in the park. And the best thing about it: you don't have to write a single line of server-side code.

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to leverage Firebase UI to create a group chat app you can share with your friends. It's going to be a very simple app with just one chat room, which is open to all users.

As you might have guessed, the app will depend on Firebase Auth to manage user registration and sign in. It will also use Firebase's real-time database to store the group chat messages.
